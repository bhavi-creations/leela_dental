                <p>
                Composite filling treatment is a restorative dental procedure used to repair decayed, chipped, cracked, or worn-down teeth. Unlike traditional silver (amalgam) fillings, composite fillings are made from a tooth-colored resin material, providing a natural and seamless appearance.

                    The procedure begins with a dental examination, where the dentist identifies and evaluates the damaged or decayed tooth. The affected area is then cleaned and the decayed portion is removed to prepare the tooth for filling. Local anesthesia is applied to ensure a comfortable and painless experience.

                    <p>
                    Once the tooth is prepared, the dentist applies the tooth-colored composite resin in layers. Each layer is hardened using a curing light to ensure strong adhesion. The composite material is then shaped and contoured to match the natural structure of the tooth for a perfect fit.

                    After the filling is set, the dentist smooths and polishes the tooth to blend seamlessly with the surrounding teeth. Bite adjustments are made to ensure proper alignment and comfort. Patients receive post-treatment care instructions, including maintaining good oral hygiene and avoiding hard foods for a short period. With proper care, composite fillings can last many years, providing a strong and natural-looking restoration.
