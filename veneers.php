                    Root canal treatment is a common dental procedure designed to save a tooth that has become severely damaged or infected, often due to deep decay or trauma. The purpose of this treatment is to remove the infected or damaged pulp (the soft tissue inside the tooth), clean and seal the tooth to prevent further infection, and ultimately preserve the natural tooth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the pulp becomes infected, it can cause severe pain, swelling, and discomfort, which can interfere with normal daily activities. Without treatment, the infection can spread, leading to the potential loss of the tooth. Root canal treatment is a highly effective solution that helps restore the tooth's function and prevent the need for extraction.

                            Veneers are a popular cosmetic dental treatment designed to enhance the appearance of your smile. These thin, custom-made shells are placed over the front surface of your teeth to correct imperfections such as stains, chips, cracks, or misalignment. Made from either porcelain or composite resin, veneers closely resemble the natural look of teeth, offering a durable and stain-resistant solution for those looking to improve their smile.

                            For individuals who have struggled with discolored teeth that do not respond well to whitening treatments, veneers can provide a permanent solution, brightening your teeth and giving you a flawless smile. In addition to correcting discoloration, veneers can also address minor alignment issues, gaps, and unevenly shaped teeth, making them an ideal choice for many people seeking a smile makeover.
