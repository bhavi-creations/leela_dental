                Pediatric dentistry is a specialized branch of dentistry focused on the oral health of infants, children, and teenagers. It involves preventive and therapeutic dental care to ensure proper growth and development of teeth and gums. Pediatric dentists are trained to handle children’s unique dental needs, making treatments comfortable and stress-free.

                    A comprehensive dental check-up, including X-rays and oral assessments, helps evaluate the child’s teeth and jaw development. Preventive care such as fluoride treatments and sealants is recommended to protect against cavities.
