                    Root canal treatment is a common dental procedure designed to save a tooth that has become severely damaged or infected, often due to deep decay or trauma. The purpose of this treatment is to remove the infected or damaged pulp (the soft tissue inside the tooth), clean and seal the tooth to prevent further infection, and ultimately preserve the natural tooth.

                <p>
                    When the pulp becomes infected, it can cause severe pain, swelling, and discomfort, which can interfere with normal daily activities. Without treatment, the infection can spread, leading to the potential loss of the tooth. Root canal treatment is a highly effective solution that helps restore the tooth's function and prevent the need for extraction.

                        <p>
                            Root canal treatment is a dental procedure designed to save a severely decayed, infected, or damaged tooth by removing the infected pulp inside it. The pulp, which contains nerves and blood vessels, can become inflamed or infected due to deep cavities, repeated dental procedures, or trauma. If left untreated, this infection can spread, leading to severe pain, abscess formation, and even tooth loss.

                        <p>
                            During the procedure, the dentist first numbs the area with local anesthesia to ensure the patientâ€™s comfort. A small opening is then made in the tooth to access the infected pulp, which is carefully removed. The inner chambers of the tooth, known as the root canals, are thoroughly cleaned, disinfected, and shaped to eliminate any remaining bacteria. Once cleaned, the space is filled with a biocompatible material to seal the canals and prevent reinfection. In most cases, a dental crown is placed over the tooth to restore its strength and functionality.
