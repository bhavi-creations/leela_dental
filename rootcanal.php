                    Root canal treatment is a common dental procedure designed to save a tooth that has become severely damaged or infected, often due to deep decay or trauma. The purpose of this treatment is to remove the infected or damaged pulp (the soft tissue inside the tooth), clean and seal the tooth to prevent further infection, and ultimately preserve the natural tooth.

                <p>
                    When the pulp becomes infected, it can cause severe pain, swelling, and discomfort, which can interfere with normal daily activities. Without treatment, the infection can spread, leading to the potential loss of the tooth. Root canal treatment is a highly effective solution that helps restore the tooth's function and prevent the need for extraction.
