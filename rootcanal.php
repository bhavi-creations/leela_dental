                    Root canal treatment is a common dental procedure designed to save a tooth that has become severely damaged or infected, often due to deep decay or trauma. The purpose of this treatment is to remove the infected or damaged pulp (the soft tissue inside the tooth), clean and seal the tooth to prevent further infection, and ultimately preserve the natural tooth.

                <p>
                    When the pulp becomes infected, it can cause severe pain, swelling, and discomfort, which can interfere with normal daily activities. Without treatment, the infection can spread, leading to the potential loss of the tooth. Root canal treatment is a highly effective solution that helps restore the tooth's function and prevent the need for extraction.

                <p>
                Root canal treatment is a restorative dental procedure used to save and repair a severely decayed or infected tooth. Instead of extracting the tooth, the infected pulp inside the root canal is removed, and the area is cleaned, disinfected, and sealed. This helps preserve the natural tooth structure while relieving pain and discomfort.

                    The dentist begins by numbing the tooth with local anesthesia to ensure a comfortable procedure. A small opening is made in the tooth, and the infected pulp and bacteria are carefully removed. The root canal is then cleaned and shaped for filling.

                    Once the infection is removed, the root canal is disinfected to eliminate any remaining bacteria. It is then filled with a biocompatible material called gutta-percha, which prevents reinfection. The opening is temporarily or permanently sealed to protect the tooth.

                    After healing, a custom-made dental crown is placed on the tooth to restore its strength, function, and appearance. The crown protects the treated tooth from damage and ensures long-term durability. With proper care, a root canal-treated tooth can last a lifetime.
