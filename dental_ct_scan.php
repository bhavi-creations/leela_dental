                A Dental CT Scan (Cone Beam Computed Tomography – CBCT) is a state-of-the-art imaging technology that provides detailed 3D views of the teeth, jawbones, nerves, and surrounding structures. Unlike traditional X-rays, which offer only two-dimensional images, CBCT scans allow dentists to examine complex anatomical details with high accuracy.

                This advanced imaging technique is commonly used for dental implant planning, root canal evaluation, wisdom tooth extraction, orthodontic treatment, and diagnosing jaw disorders or oral pathologies. It helps in detecting hidden infections, bone abnormalities, and nerve positions, ensuring safe and effective treatment.

                                Dental scanner equipment is an advanced imaging technology used in modern dentistry to capture precise digital impressions of a patient’s oral structures. It replaces traditional impression materials, offering a more accurate, efficient, and comfortable experience for both dentists and patients.

                                There are different types of dental scanners, including intraoral scanners, desktop scanners, and CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) scanners. Intraoral scanners are handheld devices that scan the inside of the mouth, while desktop scanners are used in dental labs to digitize physical impressions. CBCT scanners provide detailed 3D imaging of teeth, bones, and soft tissues, essential for implant planning and orthodontics.
