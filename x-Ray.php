                3D X-ray technology, also known as Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), provides a comprehensive, three-dimensional view of the teeth, jaw, and surrounding structures, offering significantly more detail than traditional 2D X-rays. This advanced imaging technique is particularly useful in areas such as dental implants, root canal treatments, orthodontics, and oral surgery, as it allows dentists to visualize bone density, nerve pathways, and the precise positioning of teeth and roots.

                    One of the key areas of maxillofacial surgery is the treatment of facial trauma. Injuries to the face, whether from accidents, sports, or other incidents, can cause fractures of the jaw, cheekbones, or facial bones. These injuries can result in pain, difficulty eating or speaking, and aesthetic concerns. Maxillofacial surgeons are trained to repair these fractures, ensuring proper alignment of the facial bones and restoring normal function.
