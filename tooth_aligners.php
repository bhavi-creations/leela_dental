                Tooth aligners are a modern and discreet alternative to traditional braces, designed to gradually straighten teeth without the use of metal brackets or wires. Made from clear, medical-grade plastic, aligners are custom-fitted to each patient’s teeth, providing a comfortable and nearly invisible solution for achieving a straighter smile.

                        Tooth aligners are a popular alternative to traditional braces for straightening teeth. These clear, removable trays are custom-designed to gradually shift your teeth into their correct positions. They offer a more comfortable and discreet option, as they are nearly invisible when worn. Treatment with aligners typically requires a series of trays that are changed every few weeks, with progress monitored by your dentist. Ideal for both teens and adults, aligners provide a flexible and effective solution for achieving a beautiful smile without the visible appearance of metal braces.

                        <!-- <p>
                            During the procedure, the dentist first numbs the area with local anesthesia to ensure the patient’s comfort. A small opening is then made in the tooth to access the infected pulp, which is carefully removed. The inner chambers of the tooth, known as the root canals, are thoroughly cleaned, disinfected, and shaped to eliminate any remaining bacteria. Once cleaned, the space is filled with a biocompatible material to seal the canals and prevent reinfection. In most cases, a dental crown is placed over the tooth to restore its strength and functionality.

                            You wear the clear aligners for 20-22 hours daily, changing to a new set every few weeks to gradually straighten your teeth.
