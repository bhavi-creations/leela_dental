                3D X-ray technology, also known as Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), provides a comprehensive, three-dimensional view of the teeth, jaw, and surrounding structures, offering significantly more detail than traditional 2D X-rays. This advanced imaging technique is particularly useful in areas such as dental implants, root canal treatments, orthodontics, and oral surgery, as it allows dentists to visualize bone density, nerve pathways, and the precise positioning of teeth and roots.

                            3D X-ray, also known as Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), is an advanced imaging technology used in dentistry to provide detailed three-dimensional views of the teeth, jawbone, and surrounding structures. Unlike traditional two-dimensional X-rays, 3D X-rays offer a more comprehensive assessment, allowing dentists to accurately diagnose complex dental conditions, plan surgeries, and design precise treatment approaches. This technology is particularly beneficial for procedures such as dental implants, root canal treatments, orthodontics, and maxillofacial surgeries, as it provides clear and high-resolution images with minimal radiation exposure.
