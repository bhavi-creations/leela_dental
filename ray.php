                            In modern dentistry, accurate diagnostics play a crucial role in planning and delivering effective treatments. Traditional 2D X-rays have long been used to diagnose dental issues, but advancements in imaging technology have led to the development of 3D X-Ray equipment. At Leela Dental, we utilize the latest 3D X-ray technology to provide highly detailed and precise images that allow for more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning.

3D X-ray imaging, also known as Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), is an advanced imaging technique that produces three-dimensional images of the teeth, jaw, and surrounding structures. Unlike traditional 2D X-rays, which can only show a flat image of the area, 3D X-rays create detailed cross-sectional images, providing a more comprehensive view.
