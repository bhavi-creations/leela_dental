                3D X-ray technology, also known as Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), provides a comprehensive, three-dimensional view of the teeth, jaw, and surrounding structures, offering significantly more detail than traditional 2D X-rays. This advanced imaging technique is particularly useful in areas such as dental implants, root canal treatments, orthodontics, and oral surgery, as it allows dentists to visualize bone density, nerve pathways, and the precise positioning of teeth and roots.

                            In modern dentistry, accurate diagnostics play a crucial role in planning and delivering effective treatments. Traditional 2D X-rays have long been used to diagnose dental issues, but advancements in imaging technology have led to the development of 3D X-Ray equipment. At Leela Dental, we utilize the latest 3D X-ray technology to provide highly detailed and precise images that allow for more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning.

<strong>What is 3D X-Ray in Dentistry?</strong>
3D X-ray imaging, also known as Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), is an advanced imaging technique that produces three-dimensional images of the teeth, jaw, and surrounding structures. Unlike traditional 2D X-rays, which can only show a flat image of the area, 3D X-rays create detailed cross-sectional images, providing a more comprehensive view.
