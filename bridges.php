                A dental bridge is a restorative dental treatment designed to replace one or more missing teeth. It consists of a false tooth or teeth, which are anchored to the neighboring natural teeth or dental implants. Dental bridges are typically used when a patient has one or more missing teeth and wants to restore the function, appearance, and overall health of their smile.

                <p >
                The primary purpose of a dental bridge is to fill the gap left by a missing tooth, restoring the ability to chew and speak properly. It also helps prevent the surrounding teeth from shifting into the gap, which could lead to further dental issues. Bridges are made from durable materials such as porcelain, ceramic, or metal, designed to match the natural color of your teeth, ensuring that the bridge blends seamlessly with your smile.

                        A dental bridge is a restorative solution used to replace one or more missing teeth, bridging the gap left behind by a missing tooth. It consists of two or more crowns placed on the adjacent healthy teeth, with a false tooth (pontic) in between, to fill the space.

</p>

                        <p>
                        Dental bridges are designed to look and function like natural teeth, helping restore your ability to chew, speak, and smile with confidence. They are custom-made to fit your mouth, ensuring a comfortable and durable solution.

                            Your dentist will assess your oral health and take X-rays to determine if a bridge is the right solution. If so, they will prepare the adjacent teeth by reshaping them to allow space for the crowns that will anchor the bridge.

                            Once the teeth are prepared, impressions of your mouth are taken to create a custom bridge. While the permanent bridge is being made, youâ€™ll wear a temporary bridge to protect the area.

                            <p>
                            After the permanent bridge is ready, your dentist will place it over the prepared teeth, making sure it fits comfortably and securely. Adjustments are made as needed before permanently bonding the bridge in place.
