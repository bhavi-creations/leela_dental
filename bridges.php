                A dental bridge is a restorative dental treatment designed to replace one or more missing teeth. It consists of a false tooth or teeth, which are anchored to the neighboring natural teeth or dental implants. Dental bridges are typically used when a patient has one or more missing teeth and wants to restore the function, appearance, and overall health of their smile.

                <p >
                The primary purpose of a dental bridge is to fill the gap left by a missing tooth, restoring the ability to chew and speak properly. It also helps prevent the surrounding teeth from shifting into the gap, which could lead to further dental issues. Bridges are made from durable materials such as porcelain, ceramic, or metal, designed to match the natural color of your teeth, ensuring that the bridge blends seamlessly with your smile.
