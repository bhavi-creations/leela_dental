                    Dental implants are a modern and highly effective solution for replacing missing teeth. They consist of a titanium post that is surgically placed into the jawbone, acting as a replacement for the tooth root. Once the implant integrates with the bone (a process called osseointegration), a crown, bridge, or denture is placed on top to restore the appearance and function of a natural tooth.

                    One of the main advantages of dental implants is their ability to provide a long-lasting and stable solution compared to traditional dentures or bridges. Implants are designed to look, feel, and function like natural teeth, allowing patients to eat, speak, and smile with confidence. Additionally, implants help preserve the jawbone, as they stimulate bone growth, preventing bone loss that often occurs after tooth loss.

                Dental implant treatment is a permanent solution for replacing missing teeth by surgically placing a titanium post into the jawbone. This post acts as an artificial tooth root, providing a strong foundation for a replacement tooth, such as a crown, bridge, or denture.

                    The first step involves surgically placing the titanium implant into the jawbone. Local anesthesia is used to ensure a painless procedure. The implant is carefully inserted into the bone beneath the gums, acting as a stable anchor for the replacement tooth. The gum is then stitched, allowing the area to heal.

                    <p>
                    Over the next few months, the implant naturally fuses with the jawbone through a process called osseointegration. This creates a strong and secure foundation for the artificial tooth. During this healing period, a temporary restoration may be placed to maintain aesthetics.

                    <p>
                    Once healing is complete, a custom-made dental crown, bridge, or denture is securely attached to the implant using an abutment. The crown is designed to match the size, shape, and color of natural teeth, restoring both functionality and aesthetics. Patients receive care instructions to ensure long-lasting results.
