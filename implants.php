                    Dental implants are a modern and highly effective solution for replacing missing teeth. They consist of a titanium post that is surgically placed into the jawbone, acting as a replacement for the tooth root. Once the implant integrates with the bone (a process called osseointegration), a crown, bridge, or denture is placed on top to restore the appearance and function of a natural tooth.

                    One of the main advantages of dental implants is their ability to provide a long-lasting and stable solution compared to traditional dentures or bridges. Implants are designed to look, feel, and function like natural teeth, allowing patients to eat, speak, and smile with confidence. Additionally, implants help preserve the jawbone, as they stimulate bone growth, preventing bone loss that often occurs after tooth loss.

                <p>
                    Dental implants are a permanent and reliable solution for replacing missing teeth. Made from biocompatible titanium, the implant is surgically placed into the jawbone, where it fuses with the bone to create a strong foundation for a custom-made dental crown. This integration process ensures stability and durability, allowing the implant to function like a natural tooth.

                <p>
                    The treatment begins with a thorough evaluation to assess bone density and oral health. Once the implant is placed, a healing period is necessary for the bone to integrate with the implant. After healing, a small connector called an abutment is attached, followed by the placement of a carefully crafted dental crown. </p>

                        The titanium implant is surgically inserted into the jawbone, where it serves as an artificial tooth root. A healing period follows, allowing the implant to integrate with the bone for a strong foundation.

                        Once the implant has fused with the jawbone, a small connector called an abutment is attached. This step ensures a secure connection between the implant and the final crown, allowing the gum tissue to heal around it.

                        A custom-made dental crown is fixed onto the abutment, completing the restoration. The crown is designed to match natural teeth in shape, color, and function, providing a permanent and natural-looking replacement.
