                Teeth jewellery treatment is a cosmetic dental procedure that involves attaching small decorative gems or crystals to the surface of a tooth. This non-invasive and painless procedure is designed to add a touch of sparkle to a person’s smile, enhancing aesthetic appeal and uniqueness.

                    The process begins with a dental consultation, where the dentist helps the patient choose the size, shape, and design of the jewellery. The selected tooth is then thoroughly cleaned and dried to ensure proper adhesion of the jewellery.

                    <p>
                    A safe dental adhesive is applied to the tooth’s surface, and the jewellery piece is carefully placed. A curing light is then used to harden and secure the bond, ensuring the jewellery stays in place. The process is quick, painless, and does not require drilling or enamel removal.

                    Once the jewellery is bonded, the dentist makes final adjustments to ensure comfort and positioning. Patients receive aftercare instructions, including avoiding excessive force while eating and maintaining good oral hygiene. Teeth jewellery can last several months to years and can be easily removed or replaced upon request.
