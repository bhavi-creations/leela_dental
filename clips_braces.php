                Braces are highly effective orthodontic tools used to treat a variety of dental issues, including overcrowded teeth, gaps, overbites, underbites, and crossbites. By applying gentle, consistent pressure over time, braces gradually shift the teeth into their proper position, resulting in a more aligned and functional bite.

                    A comprehensive orthodontic examination, including X-rays and digital scans, is conducted to assess teeth alignment and jaw structure. The orthodontist discusses treatment options and recommends the most suitable type of braces based on individual needs.

                    Braces are carefully placed on the teeth, and gentle pressure is applied to gradually shift them into alignment. Regular follow-up visits are scheduled for adjustments, ensuring steady progress and maximum comfort throughout the treatment.

                    Once the treatment is complete, braces are removed, and a retainer is provided to maintain the newly aligned teeth. Good oral hygiene, dietary precautions, and routine dental check-ups help preserve long-lasting results and a beautiful smile.
